### Using the extension

After you complete the post-installation configuration above, the process runs as follows:

1. A new Firebase user signs up (you can do this on the console with an email address and password)

2. The extension checks whether the user has an unverified email address. If they do, the extension sends them a verification email

### Monitoring

As a best practice, you can [monitor the activity](https://firebase.google.com/docs/extensions/manage-installed-extensions#monitor) of your installed extension, including checks on its health, usage, and logs.
